# CS-360-Project-III

# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal was to create a weight tracking app with a three table SQLite database containing user login, daily weights and target goal weight. This app was designed to assist a user with weight loss.
The user would enter a weight goal and record their daily weight progress until achieving their goal.
# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
Home screen,login screen and a grid style page for the user to enter a target goal and daily weight entries. I tried to use the Model,View, and Controller (MVC) architecture to accomplish this goal.
The app was designed to be intuitive and user friendly by keeping a consistent UI design throughout the app.
# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I created a user story to capture the purpose of the app and include features that would be used to achieve this goal. I believe these strategies would work well for any future projects as well.
# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I conducted Junit testing for this app. I also debugged the app during the build. I was also able to use the device emulator to see how the app responded as a user.This revealed any potential problems with the execution of my app.
# Considering the full app design and development process,from initial planning to finalization,where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge.
I had to re-evaluate the process and incorporate changes to the UI structure to overcome a challenge. I would also incorporate additional research to accomplish it.
# In what specific component from your mobile app were you aprticularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I found that by experimenting with UI designs and coding methods I was able to better understand and improve on my skills for mobile application development.
